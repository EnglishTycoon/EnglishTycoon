- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brian and my username is @EnglishTycoon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in helping people improve their business English, increase their confidence in communicating in business English, and show them how to get their dream job. I  only work with 20 clients at a time, so I almost always have a waiting list. So please reach out since I only work first-come-first-serve.
- ðŸŒ± I'm new to github, so feel free to let me know if I shouldn't offer this type of service here and I'll remove my profile.  I'm only here to help those who wish to engage with me directly, not to bother people.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... brian@englishtycoon.com or https://linkedin.com/in/ibrianthomas or https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJEjb224xWM7bfEWunIfAg
